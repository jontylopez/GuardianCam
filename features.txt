🎯 Why These Algorithms Are Better:
1. ResNet50V2 vs EfficientNetB0:
Better feature extraction for human body parts
Deeper architecture captures more complex patterns
Proven performance in medical imaging tasks
2. Attention Mechanism:
Focuses on critical body parts (head, torso, limbs)
Reduces noise from background
Improves fall detection accuracy
3. Focal Loss:
Handles class imbalance better than cross-entropy
Focuses on hard examples (rare fall cases)
Reduces false negatives for falls
4. Advanced Augmentation:
Simulates real-world conditions (lighting, motion blur)
Increases dataset diversity
Improves model generalization
5. Fine-tuning Strategy:
Unfreezes last layers for domain adaptation
Lower learning rate prevents catastrophic forgetting
Better convergence on small datasets
🚀 Expected Improvements:
With these changes, you should see:
Accuracy: 71% → 85%+
Better fall detection (reduced false negatives)
More robust to lighting and angle variations
Better generalization to real-world scenarios
